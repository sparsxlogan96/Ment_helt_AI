Also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems.
Symptoms can vary from mild to severe and may include feelings of sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, changes in sleep, appetite, and energy level, and difficulty concentrating.
Treatment often involves therapy, medication, or a combination of both.
