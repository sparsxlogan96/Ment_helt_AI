Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a structured, goal-oriented form of talk therapy that helps people identify and change unhelpful thinking patterns and behaviors. It is based on the core principle that thoughts, feelings, and actions are interconnected, and a change in one area can influence the others. 
Core concepts of CBT
The cognitive model: CBT operates on the principle that it's often not the event itself that causes problems, but our perception or interpretation of that event. By understanding and challenging unhelpful perceptions, an individual can reduce their emotional distress and improve their behavior.
Cognition and emotion: Your thoughts influence how you feel. For example, if you have the thought, "I am going to fail this presentation," you will likely feel anxious and upset.
Cognition and behavior: Your thoughts also influence your actions. In the same example, the thought of failing might lead you to avoid practicing your presentation, which can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Present-focused and time-limited: Unlike some other forms of therapy that delve deep into past experiences, CBT primarily focuses on current problems and difficulties. It is designed to be a short-term treatment, often lasting between 5 and 20 sessions.
Collaborative and active process: In CBT, the therapist and client work as a team. The client is an active participant in their own recovery, taking what they learn in sessions and practicing it in their daily life through "homework". The therapist acts as a guide, helping the client develop the skills they need to manage their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. 
Key techniques and components of CBT
Psychoeducation: Understanding your condition is a cornerstone of CBT. The therapist provides information about your specific problem, helping you recognize how your thoughts and behaviors may be contributing to your issues.
Cognitive restructuring: This technique involves identifying, challenging, and changing negative or unhelpful thought patterns, also known as "cognitive distortions". The goal is to replace these thoughts with more realistic and balanced ones. Common cognitive distortions include:
Catastrophizing: Assuming the worst possible outcome will happen.
Overgeneralization: Taking an isolated negative event and applying it to everything.
Black-and-white thinking: Viewing situations in extremes, with no middle ground.
Behavioral activation: This technique is particularly useful for depression. It involves scheduling and engaging in enjoyable or meaningful activities to combat withdrawal and increase positive experiences.
Exposure therapy: Often used for anxiety disorders and phobias, this involves gradually and systematically exposing yourself to the things you fear. The controlled exposure allows you to confront your anxieties and learn that the feared outcome is unlikely to happen.
Mindfulness and relaxation techniques: CBT incorporates practices like deep breathing and meditation to help reduce tension and anxiety. Mindfulness helps you become more aware of your present thoughts and feelings without judgment.
Problem-solving: Therapy often includes learning how to break down overwhelming tasks or problems into smaller, more manageable steps.
Socratic questioning: The therapist uses thoughtful questions to help you examine the evidence for and against your negative thoughts. This process allows you to arrive at more realistic conclusions on your own, rather than simply being told what to think.
