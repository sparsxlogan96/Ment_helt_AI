Depression is a prevalent and serious mood disorder that negatively impacts how a person feels, thinks, and behaves. It is different from temporary sadness or grief and is diagnosed when symptoms persist for at least two weeks. Effective treatments, including psychotherapy, medication, and lifestyle changes, are available, and most people with depression can feel better with proper care. 
Symptoms of depression
Depression symptoms can vary in severity and presentation depending on the person's age, and can include: 
Emotional: Persistent feelings of sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness. This can also present as irritability and angry outbursts, especially in children and adolescents.
Loss of interest: A significant loss of pleasure or interest in most, if not all, normal activities, such as sex, hobbies, or sports.
Sleep disturbances: Sleeping too much (hypersomnia) or too little (insomnia).
Energy levels: Fatigue and lack of energy, with even small tasks requiring extra effort.
Appetite and weight: Significant weight loss or gain, or a change in appetite unrelated to dieting.
Agitation or slowed movements: Noticeable restlessness or, conversely, slowed speech or body movements.
Cognitive issues: Difficulty concentrating, remembering things, or making decisions.
Feelings of worthlessness: Feelings of excessive or inappropriate guilt and self-blame.
Physical aches: Unexplained physical problems like headaches or back pain.
Suicidal thoughts: Frequent or recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts. 
Causes and risk factors
The exact cause of depression is unknown, but a combination of factors is believed to contribute to its development. 
Brain chemistry: Imbalances in brain neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine can play a significant role.
Genetics: Depression often runs in families. Having a first-degree relative with depression significantly increases the risk.
Hormones: Changes in hormone balance, such as during pregnancy, postpartum, or menopause, can trigger depression.
Environmental factors: Continuous exposure to abuse, neglect, or traumatic events can increase a person's risk.
Medical conditions: Chronic illnesses like heart disease, cancer, and chronic pain can contribute to depression.
Stressful life events: Difficult life experiences like bereavement, job loss, or financial problems can act as triggers. 
Common types of depression
Depression is not a single condition but a category of mood disorders. 
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): Characterized by a persistent sad mood and loss of interest for at least two weeks. It is the most severe and common form of depression.
Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD): A long-lasting but less severe form of depression where symptoms persist for at least two years.
Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD): A form of major depression that typically occurs during the fall and winter months due to reduced sunlight.
Postpartum Depression (PPD): Affects women in the weeks and months after childbirth, involving intense sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion.
Psychotic Depression: A severe form of depression accompanied by psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions.
Bipolar Disorder (Manic Depression): Involves alternating episodes of major depression and mania (periods of extreme high energy and elevated mood). 
Treatment for depression
Treatment for depression often involves a combination of medication, psychotherapy, and lifestyle changes. 
Psychotherapy (Talk Therapy)
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): Helps individuals identify and change the unhelpful thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to their depression.
Interpersonal Therapy (IPT): Focuses on improving communication and relationship skills to resolve interpersonal issues that may be contributing to depression.
Psychodynamic Therapy: Explores unconscious conflicts and past traumas to uncover underlying causes of depression. 
Medication
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): Often the first-line treatment, these medications work by increasing serotonin levels in the brain. Examples include fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft).
Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs): These increase both serotonin and norepinephrine levels in the brain.
Atypical Antidepressants: A diverse group of medications like bupropion (Wellbutrin) that act differently from SSRIs and SNRIs.
Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) and Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): Older antidepressants that are less commonly prescribed today due to more significant side effects and interactions.
Esketamine: A nasal spray approved for treatment-resistant depression that can provide rapid relief. 
Lifestyle changes and self-care
Exercise: Regular physical activity, even moderate, can boost mood and increase natural endorphins.
Diet: Eating regular, healthy meals and avoiding excessive alcohol and caffeine can help manage symptoms.
Sleep: Maintaining a regular sleep schedule is crucial for managing depressive symptoms.
Social Support: Staying connected with friends and family can combat feelings of isolation.
Mindfulness: Meditation and other mindfulness practices can help manage negative thoughts and focus on the present.
