# --- Documentation of Ethical Considerations with Local FAISS ---

# 1. Data Privacy and Security:
#    - With a local FAISS index, the vector database is stored locally on the machine running the Streamlit application.
#    - **New Consideration:** The security of the user's data (conversation history, which is used to build the RAG prompt) and the local vector store (containing embeddings of mental health data) is now dependent on the security of the local machine/environment where the application is deployed.
#    - In a multi-user or cloud deployment scenario where the application is run on a server, appropriate access controls and server-level security measures are crucial to protect the local data files.
#    - If the application is run by an individual user on their personal machine, the privacy is generally higher as data doesn't leave their device, but local machine security is paramount.
#    - The principle of not storing user data beyond the session remains, which helps mitigate long-term privacy risks regardless of local vs. cloud storage of the *knowledge base*.

# 2. Model Bias:
#    - The LLM and embedding model biases remain the same as they are loaded models, not specific to the vector store type.
#    - Bias in the *source documents* used to build the FAISS index can directly impact the RAG output. If the mental health data is biased, the retrieved context will be biased, potentially leading to biased responses.
#    - **Adjustment Needed:** Careful curation and review of the local mental health data files are essential to minimize bias in the knowledge base.

# 3. Limitations of AI in Mental Health:
#    - These limitations are inherent to the AI models and the nature of AI support, and are not directly changed by using a local vector store.
#    - The disclaimer remains critical and its prominence in the UI is confirmed.

# 4. Handling High-Severity Situations:
#    - The keyword-based safety check in `generate_response` and the crisis hotline recommendations for 'high' severity are confirmed to be integrated and functional in the code.
#    - The mechanism for identifying high severity is based on sentiment analysis and keyword matching on the user's input, which is independent of the vector store.
#    - The local FAISS index does not directly participate in the high-severity detection or crisis recommendation logic itself, but it provides context that *might* influence the LLM's response in non-crisis scenarios.

# 5. Transparency and Explainability:
#    - Transparency about the AI nature and limitations remains important, as addressed by the disclaimer.
#    - The RAG approach (local or cloud) can potentially improve explainability by allowing inspection of the retrieved documents, although this is not currently exposed in the UI.

# 6. Potential for Misuse or Dependence:
#    - This risk is related to user behavior and the agent's conversational style, not directly to the vector store location.

# 7. Continuous Monitoring and Improvement:
#    - Monitoring of conversation logs (if implemented) and user feedback is still necessary, and these logs would be stored locally if not sent elsewhere.
#    - Refinements to the RAG system (embedding model, retrieval parameters, source data) are ongoing needs.

# --- Summary of Ethical Considerations with Local FAISS ---
# The main ethical impact of switching to a local FAISS index is the shift in data security responsibility to the deployment environment. The security of the local machine or server running the application is paramount for protecting the knowledge base data. Bias in the source documents for the local index becomes a direct concern for RAG output bias. Existing safeguards like the disclaimer, safety keywords, and crisis recommendations remain integrated and crucial.
