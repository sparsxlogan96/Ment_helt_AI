Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a common type of talk therapy.
It helps you become aware of inaccurate or negative thinking so you can view challenging situations more clearly and respond to them in a more effective way.
CBT is used to treat a wide range of issues including depression, anxiety disorders, and phobias.
Key principles include identifying distorted thinking, modifying beliefs, and changing behaviors.
