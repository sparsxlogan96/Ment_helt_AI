Anxiety is a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease, typically about an imminent event or something with an uncertain outcome.
It can manifest physically with symptoms like a racing heart, sweating, and trembling.
Managing anxiety often involves techniques like deep breathing, mindfulness, and challenging anxious thoughts, which are often addressed in CBT.
Severe anxiety might require professional intervention, including therapy or medication.
